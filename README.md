# React Native AsyncStorage Inconsistent Data Retrieval

This repository demonstrates a bug related to inconsistent data retrieval using AsyncStorage in React Native.  The issue is that data retrieval is sometimes successful and sometimes returns null even when the data exists.  The solution provided addresses this problem by implementing error handling and data verification strategies. 

## Bug Description

The core problem is the unpredictable nature of AsyncStorage's `getItem` method.  It doesn't consistently return the stored data, leading to unexpected null values and application crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves more robust error handling and data validation.  It includes logging for debugging and a retry mechanism to handle temporary retrieval failures.  More importantly, it verifies the retrieved data before use to prevent null pointer exceptions.
